# Timeseries_Practice
- A series of projects using different methodologies for sequence predictions in a temperature/ time series dataset. I will be working an REU position this summer researching energy efficient cluster systems solutions that use predictions about temperature. Specifically, since we will be honing in on making predictions about the tempurature of various components of the system, we will be using various different techniques such as LSTMs, RNN with attention mechanisms and XGBoosted Regressors. This repo will be filled with the various tutorials I follow and practice I undergo in prep for the REU position.
