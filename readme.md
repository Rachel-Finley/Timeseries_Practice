# Timeseries_Practice
- A series of projects using different methodologies for predicting time series data, specifically temperature. I will be working an REU position this summer working on energy efficient cluster systems doing data science. Specifically, since we will be honing in on making predictions about the tempurature of various components of the system, we will be using various different techniques such as LSTM'S with attention mechanism. and XGBoosted Regressors. This repo will be filled with the various tutorials I follow and practice I undergo in prep for the REU position.
